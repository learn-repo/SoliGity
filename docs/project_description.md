# Project Description 


## Introduction
The course project of EECE571G is to let you try your best to build a decentralized application (DApp). As this is graduate course, students are expected to form a software development team to do this project. 

## Requirement 
### a. Team Building
i.	The project is a team-based project (i.e. group project). We have 3 ~ 5 students in each team. A team should have at least 3 students. 

ii.	Please print the team form given you in the appendix of this document out and the members of each team need to fill the form and give their signatures properly. The team should submit the form in the midterm week.

iii.	Certainly, every student can join at most one group. 

### b.	Contents
i.	Think about a simple application to develop with the blockchain technology.  

ii.	Setup the development environment 
The team needs to setup the Truffle + React + Web3js development environments. 

iii.	Each group should create a project on GitHub and put your project on the GitHub. In the end of the term, please send me the link of your project repository on GitHub. 

iv.	Your project should be runnable and functional.

v.	In your Assignment 2 (which is group based), please submit the follows:

1.	The **`whitepaper`** of your project (i.e., a document describes the application). 
2.	The **`wireframe`**.
3.	The **`smart contract`** code.
4.	The **`test code`** for your smart contract.

vi.	Project demo and final report submission are needed in the end.

## Evaluation 
a.	Presentation
In the **very last week**, we have a presentation course. The presentation takes 70% of your project evaluation. 

b.	Report
The report should be `at least 20 pages` of main contents in **`Letter paper`, `Font Size = 12`, `1.5 times line spacing`, with `Normal margin` in `MS Word (2.54 cm for all sides)`.** Pictures (like screenshots) are encouraged in the report, but **the number of pictures cannot exceed 15** and the size of picture should meet the following requirements **`(Height < 8cm and Width < 14cm)`**.
Violation with any of the above rules may result in the deduction of your project marks.

c.	Fairness
Each team should fill in a Peer-to-Peer evaluation form for fairness purposes.
Each team member will receive the inner-team evaluation for his/her contributions of the course project in a percentage. That is, the sum of `all members’ percentage marks should NOT exceed 100%`, and ALL team member should sign clearly to show that they have reached an agreement.

If the sum of percentages overall team members exceeds 100% OR any student’s signature is missing, the form is INVALID. The form should be submitted together with the course project report on the project presentation day.
